# HTLN-Data-Capture-Scripts

Data workflows from Survey123 and other field loggers into MS Access and other 
relational databases.

# Notes

The Wetlands folder contains R scripts to process Survey123 spreadsheets so
they can be appended to VIBI herbaceous, VIBI woody and VIBI big tree tables
in the HTLNWetlands Access database. The scripts also include end-to-end
tests that compare the original spreadsheet data with exported tables *after*
the new data have been appended.
